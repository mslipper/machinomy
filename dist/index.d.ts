 * Machinomy is a library for micropayments in Ether (and ERC20 tokens) over HTTP.
 * Machinomy provides API to send and receive a minuscule amount of money instantly.
 * Core method is [buy]{@link Machinomy.buy}. The method does all the heavy lifting providing an easy interface
 * for micropayments.
 *
 * NB. All monetary values below are denominated in Wei, including: [buy]{@link Machinomy.buy} and
 * [deposit]{@link Machinomy.deposit} methods.
 *
 * You can find ES5 example in this {@link https://github.com/machinomy/machinomy/tree/master/examples folder} of the project.
